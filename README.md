# spec_filler

I have a habit of taking gigs that have literally zero testing in place. 
I wrote this after losing two hours to setting up a single factory that happened to have more than 100 attributes between copying and formatting. 

This will become a gem that you can drop into your Rails project to generate FactoryBot files based off of the schema.
